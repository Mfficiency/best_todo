## 1. The ultimate todo list
To find the ultimate todo list I will download and try the top 30 apps in the google play store.
### What are the top 30 apps
Go to play.google.com on a pc and search for "todo". Picking the top 30 results (out of 245).
Making sure I don't miss the top rated (4.5 or higher) when going to the play store on the phone.
